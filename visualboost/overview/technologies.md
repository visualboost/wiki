# Advantages

VisualBoost brings about **two main things**:

## For Backend Developments:

* You get a the source code of a complete **REST API**.
* It's built with **NodeJS** and **Express**.
* It uses **MongoDB** as its database.
* The backend is **easily expandable** to incorporate your custom business logic.

## For Frontend:

* You receive client code in [**Java**](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] **or Kotlin**.&#x20;
* This lets you easily interact with the REST API directly and focus on the UI.



[^1]: Can be used for Kotlin projects as well.

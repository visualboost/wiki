# Model

In the context of VisualBoost, a model defines a technical object.&#x20;

To specify a model, properties can be created. These characterize the entity. For example, for an address data model, properties such as first name, last name, email address, and phone number can be defined.&#x20;





VisualBoost offers the possibility to further customize these properties, such as specifying whether an attribute is required or should be unique, or adding a description. Overall, a model enables a clear definition and organization of the structure and data of a backend application, making development more efficient and facilitating application management.



In addition, it's important to note that a model always requires a name. This name must be unique within the application scope, meaning it must be unique within a package or globally if the model is not contained within any package.

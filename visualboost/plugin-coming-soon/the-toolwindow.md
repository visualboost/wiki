# The ToolWindow

VisualBoost is integrated into the WebStorm development environment as a Tool Window. It allows software developers to easily and efficiently design their REST APIs and, upon building, instantly receive the generated code.&#x20;

As shown in the example above, the VisualBoost-Plugin will pull the latest changes automatically after the build is confirmed.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: In order to receive the changes after building, it is necessary that Git is installed
{% endhint %}

We recommend starting the Node.js application as a daemon process. This ensures that once the new code is pulled, the functionalities are immediately available and can be tested right away.

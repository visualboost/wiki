VisualBoost can also be run on a PC or your own server. For this purpose, please visit our [official Github repository](https://github.com/visualboost/VisualBoost). There, you will find detailed instructions for setting up and deploying VisualBoost in your local environment.

**Please note:** Upon your first interaction with VisualBoost, an administrator account will be automatically created. As the first registered user, you will automatically assume the role of administrator. This grants you the ability to install updates.

# Installation

For beginners, we recommend starting with VisualBoost by using the [cloud version](https://app.visualboost.de).

There, you can easily create an account and get started right away. More information is available under [Quick-Start](quick-start.md).

Alternatively, VisualBoost can be installed on your own PC or server. For more information, please refer to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/visualboost/VisualBoost).

# Client

Currently, VisualBoost can generate client code that enables communication with the corresponding backend application. VisualBoost currently offers two programming languages for the client side:&#x20;

* [Java](java.md)
* [Kotlin](kotlin.md)

You can choose the programming language for the client code in the settings under [**Configuration > Client**](../../../project/settings/configuration/client.md)**.**

{% hint style="info" %}
To generate the client side, it is necessary to specify the Git repository for the frontend (client) project in the [settings](../../../project/settings/git.md).
{% endhint %}

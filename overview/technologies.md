VisualBoost brings about two main things:

#### For Backend Development:

* You get a complete REST API.
* It's built with **NodeJS** and **Express**.
* It uses **MongoDB** as its database.

#### For Client Integration:

* You receive client code in [**Java**](#user-content-fn-1)[^1].&#x20;
* This lets you easily interact with the REST API directly.

[^1]: Can be used for Kotlin projects as well.
